# JetKV

_JetKV_ is a key-value store written in _Zig_ intended for use in development and production web servers. Basic in-memory and on-disk backends are provided for local development and a [Valkey](https://valkey.io/) backend is provided for production. All backends are exposed by a unified interface.

_JetKV_ can be used for:

* Background job queuing
* Persistent data storage
* Cache

_JetKV_ is used by the [Jetzig Web Framework](https://jetzig.dev/) to provide a zero-setup, in-process key-value store for all of the above.

## Usage

### Valkey Backend

Recommended for production.

```zig
var kv = try JetKV(.{
    .backend = .valkey,
    .valkey_backend_options = .{
        .pool_size = 8,
        .buffer_size = 8192,
    },
}).init(allocator);
```

### Memory Backend

Recommended for local development.

```zig
var kv = try JetKV(.{ .backend = .memory }).init(allocator);
```

### File Backend

Recommended for local development where persistent storage is required.

When using the file allocator, `JetKV.init` receives an allocator in order to provide a consistent API but does not perform any allocations. It is therefore possible to pass `undefined` instead of an allocator when using the file allocator.

The file passed as the `path` field is locked on startup.

```zig
var kv = try JetKV(.{
    .backend = .file,
    .file_backend_options = .{
        // Path to storage file (JetKV stores all data in a single, platform-agnostic file)
        .path = "/path/to/jetkv.db",
        // Set to `true` to clear the store on each launch.
        .truncate = false,
        // Set the size of the on-disk hash table (each address is currently 4 bytes)
        // Use `jetkv.addressSpaceSize` to guarantee a valid size if address size changes in future
        .address_space_size = jetkv.addressSpaceSize(4096),
    },
}).init(allocator);
```

### Key-Value Operations

All operations are identical for `.file` and `.memory` backends.

All operations are _O(1)_ complexity for both backends.

Read operations receive an allocator to allow separation of internal allocation and value reads. e.g. you may want to use one allocator for the KV store's internal storage and an arena allocator for reading values.

```zig
// Put some strings into the KV store
try kv.put("foo", "baz");
try kv.put("bar", "qux");

// `append` and `prepend` create a new array if one does not already exist
try kv.append("example_array", "quux");
try kv.prepend("example_array", "corge");

if (try kv.get(allocator, "foo")) |value| {
    // "baz"
    allocator.free(value);
}

if (try kv.fetchRemove(allocator, "bar")) |value| {
    // "qux"
    allocator.free(value);
}

// Remove a string from the KV store. Does not remove arrays.
try kv.remove("foo");

if (kv.pop(allocator, "example_array")) |value| {
    // "quux"
    allocator.free(value);
}

if (kv.popFirst(allocator, "example_array")) |value| {
    // "corge"
    allocator.free(value);
}
```

## Testing

Launch _Valkey_:

```console
docker compose up
```

Run tests:

```console
zig build test
```

## Implementation

### Valkey

Native _Zig_ adapter for [Valkey](https://valkey.io/) implementing [RESP 3](https://www.mankier.com/7/valkey-protocol).

Benchmark:

```console
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast run
```

### Memory

The memory backend uses a _Zig_ `std.StringHashMap` of `[]const u8` for string storage and `std.DoublyLinkedList([]const u8)` for array storage.

### File

The file backend implements a fixed-sized hash table at the beginning of the file.

Hash collisions are resolved as singly-linked lists. Arrays are implemented as doubly-linked lists.

Each index in the hash table references a location in the file which provides address information:

* Value type
* Next linked item (for collision resolution)
* Next array item
* Previous array item
* End array item
* Key length
* Initial key length
* Value length
* Initial value length
* Key
* Value

Values are inserted with a relative amount of over-allocation to allow re-use of space when replacing values.

Keys have a maximum length of `1024` bytes in order to allow key comparison to operate exclusively on the stack.

Reference counting is used to allow truncating the file when the store becomes empty.
